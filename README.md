# Lead Generation Agents

Lead Generation Agents is an intelligent system designed to automate the process of identifying and acquiring high-quality leads for businesses. By leveraging machine learning, data analytics, and web scraping, the platform simplifies lead generation by providing businesses with qualified leads from Google Maps based on user-defined categories and locations. The system aims to minimize manual effort while delivering actionable insights to improve lead acquisition and business growth.

# Features
## 1. Google Maps Scraping: Extracts business data (name, location, contact details, etc.) from Google Maps based on user input for category (e.g., "Real Estate") and location (e.g., "Chennai").
## 2. Automated Lead Scoring: Uses AI and machine learning models to score and qualify leads based on factors such as business size, reviews, proximity, and industry relevance.
## 3. Personalized Outreach: Enables automated email and SMS campaigns to engage with qualified leads, using personalized templates and AI-powered follow-ups.
## 4. Lead Tracking and Analytics: Provides real-time insights into lead performance, response rates, and conversions, allowing businesses to optimize their outreach strategies.
## 5. Dashboard Interface: Displays leads, lead scores, and analytics in a user-friendly interface, helping businesses manage and prioritize their outreach efforts.
## 6. CRM Integration: Integrates with popular CRM platforms like Salesforce and HubSpot to sync lead data for further management and follow-up.

# Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for scraping and data processing.
Selenium: For browser automation to scrape data from Google Maps.
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML and extracting structured data.
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn): For lead scoring and qualification based on various business factors.
SMTP/Email API & Twilio: For automated email and SMS outreach.

# How It Works
User Input: Users input a business category (e.g., "Real Estate") and a location (e.g., "Chennai").
Data Collection: The system scrapes Google Maps for relevant businesses matching the category and location.
Lead Scoring: The scraped data is processed and analyzed using AI/ML models to score and rank the leads based on conversion potential.
Lead Management: The results are displayed on a dashboard, where users can sort and filter leads based on their score, location, or other factors.
Outreach Automation: Automated emails or SMS messages are sent to high-ranking leads with personalized messages, enhancing engagement.
Tracking and Feedback: Lead interactions (e.g., email opens, replies) are tracked, and lead scores are updated dynamically based on engagement.
